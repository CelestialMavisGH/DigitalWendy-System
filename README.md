# VASE-System
Voice Activated Sound Effects (Its planned for multiple uses, such as Discord bots using voice, Twitch bots, System Commands)


Vase was a simple idea, I wanted to make a system that can take in voice commands and excute all kinds of functions, I want it to be customizable and so on, so far I made decent progress.

I'm utilizing google's Text-to-speech API as well as the Speech-to-text API, upon hearing a certain keyword, the program starts recording what you say for 6 Seconds, it then proceeds to send that data to google to decipher it, at the moment there aren't any proper commands implemented, but for the future I'd hope to make it able to do a lot of things, and potentially even add the possibility to add new commands through a UI interface.

The program is codded in the PyCharm IDE using Conda for Python ver. 3.6

Current system version 0.0.1a
