DigitalWendy (Its planned for multiple uses, such as Discord bots using voice, Twitch bots, System Commands)

DigitalWendy was a simple idea, I wanted to make a system that can take in voice commands and execute all kinds of functions, I want it to be customisable and so on, so far I made decent progress.

I'm utilizing google's Text-to-speech API as well as the Speech-to-text API, upon hearing a certain keyword, the program starts recording what you say until you stop talking, it then proceeds to send that data to google to decipher it, at the moment there simple commands implemented such as opening programs or searching youtube or just simply quitting the program, but for the future I'd hope to make it able to do a lot of things, and potentially even add the possibility to add new commands through a UI interface.

The program is being developed in the PyCharm IDE using Python 3.7

Current system version 0.001 Pre-Alpha
